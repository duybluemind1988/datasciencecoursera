## 1. Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
path <- "/media/ad/01D6B57CFBE4DB20/1.Linux/Data/JHU data/activity.csv"
data <- fread(path)
head(data)
tail(data)
```
The variables included in this dataset are:

- steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
- date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
- interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

## 2. Data exclude NA value

### 2.1 What is mean total number of steps taken per da
For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.
```{r}
dim(data)
sum(is.na(data))
null_value <- sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
null_value
```

```{r}
data_exclude_na <- na.omit(data)
dim(data_exclude_na)
```

```{r}
step_per_day <- data_exclude_na[,.(total_step = sum(steps)),by=date]
step_per_day
```


```{r}
step_per_day %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=total_step))+
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of total step per day")
```


```{r}
# Method 1: mean and median by data.table function
step_per_day[,c(lapply(.SD,median),lapply(.SD,mean)), .SDcols="total_step"]
```

```{r}
# Method 2: mean and median by summary function
summary(step_per_day$total_step) 
# median: 10765 , mean: 10766
```
### 2.2 What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
summary(data_exclude_na)
```

```{r}
average_steps_per_5min_interval <- data_exclude_na[,.(mean_step = mean(steps)),by=interval]
average_steps_per_5min_interval
```


```{r}
average_steps_per_5min_interval %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=interval,y=mean_step)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r}
average_steps_per_5min_interval[which.max(average_steps_per_5min_interval$mean_step)]
```

## 3. Imputing missing values

### 3.1 Total number of missing values in dataset
```{r}
sum(is.na(data))
```


```{r}
# Find which column have missing value
colSums(is.na(data))
```

### 3.2 Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
```{r}
data
```
```{r}
summary(data$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# impute with median value
data[is.na(steps), "steps"]  <- data[, lapply(.SD, median, na.rm=TRUE), .SDcols = "steps"]
data
```
### 3.3 Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

```{r}
data.table::fwrite(x = data, file = "data_impute_median.csv", quote = FALSE)
```

### 3.4 Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
data <- fread("data_impute_median.csv")
head(data)
```


```{r}
step_per_day <- data[,.(total_step = sum(steps)),by=date]
step_per_day
```


```{r}
step_per_day %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=total_step))+
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of total step per day")
```

```{r}
summary(step_per_day$total_step) 
# data exclude na value: median: 10765 , mean: 10766
# data impute na value: median: 10395, mean: 9354
```
Impute value make median and mean lower than not impute value

### 3.5 Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r}
data
```
1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{r}
library(timeDate)
chec_weekend <- function(date){
  if (isWeekday(date,wday = 1:5)){
    "weekday"
  }
  else{
    "weekend"
  }
}
```

```{r}
data[, week_day_check := mapply(chec_weekend, date)]
head(data)
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
```{r}
mean_data <- group_by(data, week_day_check, interval) %>%
             summarise(average_steps = mean(steps))
mean_data
```


```{r}
mean_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=interval,y=average_steps,colour = week_day_check)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~week_day_check)
```


```{r}
```


```{r}
```


```{r}
```


```{r}
```
